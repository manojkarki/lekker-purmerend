# üç∞ Lekker Purmerend - Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ **Status: Ready for Testing**

The frontend is now running successfully with all core business logic implemented and tested.

## **Access Points**

- **Frontend (WORKING)**: http://localhost:3000 ‚úÖ
- **Backend APIs**: Will start when needed ‚è≥
- **Business Logic**: Fully functional ‚úÖ

## **What's Working**

### ‚úÖ **Core Business Logic**
```bash
node test-delivery.js  # Test delivery estimation & location detection
```

- **Delivery Estimation**: Correctly calculates ETA based on prep time and daily cutoff
- **Purmerend Detection**: Identifies delivery eligibility by city name or postal code
- **Payment Matrix**: Shows correct payment options based on location and delivery method
- **Amsterdam Timezone**: All time calculations use Europe/Amsterdam timezone

### ‚úÖ **Frontend Components**
- **Homepage**: Modern, responsive design with hero section and featured products
- **Location Checker**: Interactive tool to test Purmerend detection
- **Delivery Badges**: Show estimated delivery times for products
- **Payment Selector**: Conditionally shows payment methods
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile devices

### ‚úÖ **Architecture**
- **Monorepo**: Clean separation with shared types and utilities
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components and business logic
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Scalable**: Ready for additional features

## **Test Scenarios**

### 1. **Homepage Testing**
Visit: http://localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ Page loads with hero section
- ‚úÖ Featured products display with delivery badges
- ‚úÖ Responsive design on mobile/desktop
- ‚úÖ Navigation links present

### 2. **Location Detection**
Use the "Check je bezorg- en betaalmogelijkheden" section:

**Purmerend addresses (should show delivery + all payment options):**
- City: `Purmerend`, Postal: `1441 AA`
- City: `purmerend`, Postal: `1442 BB` (case insensitive)
- City: ``, Postal: `1443 CC` (postal code only)

**Non-Purmerend (should show pickup only + limited payment):**
- City: `Amsterdam`, Postal: `1012 AB`
- City: `Utrecht`, Postal: `3511 AB`

### 3. **Delivery Estimation**
Check the featured products for delivery badges showing:
- "Vandaag" or "Morgen" based on current time
- Time ranges like "15:00‚Äì18:00"

### 4. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Test on different screen sizes
- Check touch interactions
- Verify readable text and button sizes

## **Backend Services Status**

Currently focusing on frontend functionality. Backend services will be addressed:
- **Medusa**: E-commerce backend (needs babel configuration fixes)
- **Strapi**: CMS backend (needs additional setup)
- **PostgreSQL/Redis**: Infrastructure services ready via Docker

## **Next Development Steps**

After confirming frontend functionality:
1. Fix remaining Medusa backend issues
2. Complete Strapi CMS setup
3. Implement full product CRUD
4. Set up Stripe payment processing
5. Add email notification system

## **Known Issues & Workarounds**

### Frontend Only Mode
Currently running frontend only for testing. This provides:
- ‚úÖ UI/UX validation
- ‚úÖ Business logic verification
- ‚úÖ Component functionality
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness

### Backend Integration
Will be enabled once backend services are fully configured.
