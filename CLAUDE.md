Architecture Decisions

Modular Stripe Integration:
    â€¢    Client-side: Only UI interactions (stripe.ts)
    â€¢    Server-side: All API calls and webhooks (stripe-server.ts)
    â€¢    Separation prevents import conflicts and improves security

Docker-First Development:
    â€¢    All services run in containers for consistency
    â€¢    Volume mounts for hot reload during development
    â€¢    Environment-specific configuration via compose files

TypeScript Strict Mode:
    â€¢    Full type safety throughout the application
    â€¢    Shared types package for consistency
    â€¢    Strict configuration prevents runtime errors
